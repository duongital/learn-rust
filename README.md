## motivation

- active community and a number of tuturials
- have package mananger, using function and type looking similar to JS
- my favorite apps: Alacrity, Zellij, Helix (theme by Rose Pine) written by Rust

## notes on learning

first thoughts:

- each rust program getting from `main.rs` file and there is a main function to load.
- ide: using Lapce and Vim mode are interesting
- `cargo` is same as `npm` and `rustc` is same as `node`
